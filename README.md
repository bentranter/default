#### About

The CSS was originally derived from [BassCSS](http://basscss.com), and as a result, is licensed under MIT. The CSS here should serve as a starting point for your CSS. It's enough to allow you to create any type of layout you want, and tweak it from there. It's only 14KB minified, and 3KB gzipped, paints extremely quickly, and maintains 60FPS no matter what.
